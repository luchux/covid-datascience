## cc-covid-research.ipynb
A intensive analisis of Covid and other viruses papers, categorization of topics, and query answering approximation. 

## scrapWikiPlotStats.ipynb

## requeriments
to run the notebooks, you need jupyter python. I didn't provide the requeriments, so you will need to figure them out. WIP to add them, because I worked directly in Kaggle and Google notebooks.
